Description: embeddable Scheme interpreter
 Chibi-Scheme is a really small embeddable interpreter of R7RS Scheme,
 intended for use as an extension and scripting language in C programs.
 .
 This package provides REPL and interpreter "chibi-scheme"
 as well as tools for documenting Scheme code ("chibi-doc"),
 generating FFI bindings ("chibi-ffi"),
 and managing Scheme packages ("snow-chibi").
